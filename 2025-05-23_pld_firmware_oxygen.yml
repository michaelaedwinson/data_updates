title: Payload Firmwares and Incorrect Dissolved Oxygen
content: An ongoing issue with the SeaExplorer payload firmwares of 2.24.2-r or greater is leading to dissolved oxygen values above normal and interruptions in CTD and AD2CP logging of data. Investigation is ongoing and data quality remains uncertain. All affected datasets have been flagged. Check the variable oxygen_concentration_qc and pressure_qc.
