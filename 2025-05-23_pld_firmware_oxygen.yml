title: Payload Firmwares and Incorrect Dissolved Oxygen
content: An issue with the SeaExplorer payload firmwares of 2.24.2-r, 2.25.1-cr, 2.25.1-r and 2.25.3-cr caused dissolved oxygen values above normal. On the affected missions, oxygen concentrations have been recalculated from the raw values using the function "recalc_oxygen" in votoutils/glider/fix_oxygen_alseamar_bug.py available here at https://github.com/voto-ocean-knowledge/votoutils/blob/main/votoutils/glider/fix_oxygen_alseamar_bug.py. These recalculated values replace the incorrect values in the variables oxygen_concentration. The incorrect values have been moved to a new variable named oxygen_concentration_uncorrected.
